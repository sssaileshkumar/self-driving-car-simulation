# self-driving-car-simulation
Self driving car simulation using artificial neural network and genetic algoritthm.

Overview
This project demonstrates an evolutionary AI system in which a population of autonomous cars learns to drive on a predefined track using:

1) Sensor-based navigation (5 distance sensors)
2) Neural network decision-making (simple weight matrices)
3) Genetic algorithm evolution (selection, crossover, and mutation)

The cars start with random behaviors, and over successive generations, the best-performing individuals pass on their traits, leading to gradual improvement in driving performance.

How to Run
1) Install dependencies:
    pip install numpy pygame
2) Run command:
    python app.py
